Ready to get started? Follow these detailed steps to download and install the free GTA 5 Mod Menu. We've made it simple with emojis and clear instructions. Remember, this is for educational purposes only, and always back up your game files before modding. 🔄  

1. **Prepare Your Environment:** First, ensure GTA 5 is installed via Steam or the Rockstar Games Launcher on your Windows 2025 machine. Open your file explorer and navigate to the GTA 5 installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA V). 📂  

2. **Download the Mod Menu:** Click the download badge above to grab the files. It's a straightforward process – the link will direct you to a secure source. Once downloaded, you'll have a ZIP file containing the mod menu executable and supporting files. ⏬💨  

3. **Extract the Files:** Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract Here" using a tool like 7-Zip. Place the extracted folder in a safe location, such as your Documents folder. Avoid system directories to prevent any Windows 2025 security prompts. 📦🔓  

4. **Install the Mod Menu:** Launch the installer from the extracted files. It should detect your GTA 5 installation automatically. If prompted, grant administrator permissions – Windows 2025 might show a UAC dialog for this. Follow the on-screen prompts, and select custom options if you want features like auto-updates or specific mod integrations. ⚙️🚀  

5. **Configure for Windows 2025:** After installation, open the mod menu's settings. Enable compatibility mode for Windows 2025 by going to the game's properties in your Start menu, then selecting "Run with graphics processor" if you have a dedicated GPU. This ensures smooth performance with the latest OS enhancements. 🖥️🔧  

6. **Launch GTA 5 with Mods:** Boot up GTA 5 through the mod menu launcher instead of the default executable. You'll see a dashboard with options like mod toggles and key bindings. Customize to your heart's content – for example, bind the mod menu to a key like F12 for quick access. 🎉🕹️  

Pro Tip: If you encounter errors, check Windows 2025's Event Viewer for logs. Common fixes include updating your graphics drivers or disabling antivirus temporarily. 🛠️💻
